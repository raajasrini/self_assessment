## Self Assessment 

When I began this project lot of discussion with individual ideas on selecting the topic and finally  selected  "Police Brutality". Played a database lead role in the course of the project to identify the proper cloud AWS RDS database and set up, identify the right raw data fatal encouter and wahsignton post , load and cleanse the data , find the state demographic data with races to do proper join to get right data to the ML model and dashboard view.

The slack group conversation , Zoom meetings and peer chat with various technical questions clarified helped a lot to elevate the confedence level of completing the assignment. The Git lab practice exercise was helped a lot on completing the assignment. 

The greatest personal challenge was time management despite of regular work and my personal emergency travel during the time. The instructor was helpful suring the time.  I've scheduled my calendar every day to overcome the time management challenge. TA's and Tessa helped a lot on acheiving the weekly goals.
 

## Team Assessment 

I am incredibly proud of what my team and I have accomplished during this project. Though with pandemic challenge , everyone in the team contributed well on selecting the topic , how to identify the data and references , identify the technical skill set , setting up role and responsibilities , periodic updates in zoom / slack , multiple reviews to fine tune the results. Helping each other on clarifications and hone the ML model and results achieved. 

The key strength of this team is to promote each other and connect with important discussions and stay tuned to complete the tasks in late evenings. In total, everyone have helped each other to complete the project on time.


## Project Summary   
The project is to looking at police brutality Present-day conflicts of equality vs. equity. We decided to relate the difference between equity and equality using data on police violence against minorities. 

We will use machine learning logistic regression module to see if it can predict the race of an individual killed by police using multiple variables such as: if armed, fleeing from police, age, We want to see if the individuals killed by police were indeed a threat, or were the killings race driven.

### Result of the Analysis :
    
The dataset takes in the various facotrs: age, gender, signs of mental illness, if the individual tried to flee and if in all of these instances a body camera was worn by a police officer who shot and killed the suspect. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to split and train our model because it can give us a binary classifier True or False answer, if police were or were not wearing a body camera.

This prediction helps to assist journalists, politicians, prosecutors, activists and concerned citizens who can use the evidence accumulated here for political campaigns, news reporting, public education and prosecution of police brutality , the Present-day conflicts of equality vs. equity.
